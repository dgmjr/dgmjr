## Hi there 👋

I'm David, a software engineer and part-time college professor living in Washington, DC.  This is your "portal" to all of my projects on GitHub.

- 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - I write software for the Web in ASP.NET core and some TypeScript (and some Python very very badly)?
- 🌈 Contribution guidelines - Check out the [open issues](https://projects.dgmjr.codes) or [file a ticket](https://dgmjr.boo)!
- 👩‍💻 Useful resources - One thing at a time, guys! I'm still try'n'a figure out [FrontMatter](https://frontmatter.codes) and [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).
- 🍿 Fun facts - I **love** the International House of Pancakes' pancakes!
- 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

And as the great President Lincoln once said, *"It is not the years in your life that matter, but the life in your years."*  So make each day count, boys and girls!  Take risks.  And as I once told a twink who asked me as "an older gay man, what advice [do i] have for him,"  I responded by saying, *"Do **all** of the things."*
